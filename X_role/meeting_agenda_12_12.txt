Pre-meeting agenda 12/12/22
- Time for opening checking in, chit-chat ??
- Opening business:
o Thought this would be a good idea to keep meetings organized/productive
o Will do the same with these as notes taken during meeting, add to Slack and Github so everyone has them
- Seg 1 deliverable status
o X role - Tim
* Meeting notes should be good for the comm. protocol requirement
* Stated goal of the project is a bit fuzzy in writing, can add a paragraph explaining our intentions
* 2 “actual” content commits so far; adding this agenda and notes from tonight’s meeting should get me to four, extra paragraph certainly gets me there
o Square role - Joe
* Looks good as far as structuring repository requirements
* 4 commits requirement? Could be an ongoing problem if Joe is just managing our commits but isn’t making his own?
o Circle role - Juhi
* Juhi has plenty of raw datasets and some processed data
* Status of database itself rather than the CSVs within?
* Lots of content, so guessing number of commits is fine
o Triangle role - Will
* Sample data commit is visible
* Should add the prelim model code we discussed at the last meeting, and that should be plenty for the first seg requirements
* Just be sure to make at least four separate commits to meet requirements
- Time for current concerns
- Looking ahead to Seg 2 requirements
o X role
* Need to start getting some of the data into Tableau for dashboard reqs.
* The deliverable will need to be the beginnings of a presentation using Google Slides
o Square role – Joe
* Peer-review functionality built in to GitHub – should probably focus on getting that started at this point
o Circle role – Juhi
* Transitioning from mock database to the real deal, and continuing data cleaning
* Delegating data cleaning tasks?
o Triangle role – Will
* Moving on from mock data and preliminary models to starting with the real deal
