Pre-meeting agenda 12/19/22
- Time for opening checking in, chit-chat ??
- Review of where we are each at with current tasks
- Breakdown of what needs to be done for Seg 2 deliverables (due Wednesday 12/21)
o Presentation
* Basically, it sounds like all of the information for this part is done in text form in our GitHub ReadMes; everyone comfortable with Tim just drawing from that text to build Google slides?
o GitHub
* Honestly, this doesn’t seem too different from Seg 1 requirements; need to review and make sure we’re comfortable with what’s there
o Model
* Sounds like these requirements are mostly there, but perhaps need to expand a bit on explanation on why those models chosen?
o Database
* Sounds like we have the requirements for joins on tables but “Database interfaces with the project in some format” seems vague? Maybe Tableau integration will be enough?
o Dashboard
* Pretty much just sounds like we need to include some of the Tableau worksheets in the Google slides as the storytelling format
- Planning for in-person meeting on 12/27
o Do we want to set a time? Or perhaps plan to talk via text on the 26th about what time would work for us the next day?
- Time for current concerns/forming action plan between now and next meeting
